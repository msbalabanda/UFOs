# UFOs

# OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
The goal of this project is to use JavaScript to populate an HTML table with UFO sighting data and create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input. The table will be placed into an HTML file for easy viewing. Using Bootstrap, the table is equiped with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our visualizations. 

# RESULTS

When the client browses the web page they will see a brief overview summary of UFO sightings. When they scroll to the bottom of the page there is data about UFO sightings in various countries that can be accessed using the filters (date, city, state, country and shape) on the left hand side of the screen. The user can customize their search and the HTML page will return the information based on the desired search.

# SUMMARY

The UFO sightings page allows the user to easily access information provided in our data set by the use of filters and clear structure of the webpage. 
However, we would have to factor in the drawbacks related to the information provided. A potential drawback would be the validity of the sightings that occur in a given region. The reason being, how many people actually saw it occur. A substantial population size is usually required to determine the accuracy of the claim. My recommendation for improving the website would be to have a filter that shows how many people saw the sighting and also have contant updates to the sighting data sets to ensure that the users have the most up to date informaiton.
